**Overview**

This repository serves as a hands-on exploration and learning resource for understanding the core components of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the Transformer architecture and the intricate world of tokenization. Through practical examples and code snippets, this project aims to demystify how these powerful models process and understand human language.

Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the fundamentals or an experienced practitioner wanting to refresh your knowledge, this repository provides a clear and interactive path to understanding the backbone of modern NLP.

**Project Goals**

Demystify the Transformer: Break down the encoder and decoder components, self-attention mechanisms, multi-head attention, and feed-forward networks.

Explore Tokenization Strategies: Understand different tokenization methods (e.g., WordPiece, BPE, SentencePiece), their advantages, and how they impact model performance.

Hands-on with Hugging Face Transformers: Utilize the popular Hugging Face transformers library to load pre-trained models and tokenizers, and interact with them programmatically.

Visualize Concepts: Where applicable, use visualizations to illustrate complex ideas like attention weights and token representations.

Provide a Learning Playground: Offer executable code and notebooks that allow users to experiment and modify parameters to deepen their understanding.

**Key Concepts Explored**

Attention Mechanism: Dot-product attention, scaled dot-product attention, self-attention, cross-attention.

Multi-Head Attention: Parallel attention layers for capturing diverse relationships.

Positional Encoding: How models incorporate word order.

Feed-Forward Networks: The non-linear transformations within Transformer blocks.

Encoder-Decoder Architecture: The complete Transformer model.

Pre-training & Fine-tuning (briefly mentioned): The typical lifecycle of LLMs.

Tokenization Algorithms: WordPiece, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), SentencePiece.

Special Tokens: [CLS], [SEP], [PAD], [UNK].

Vocabulary: The set of tokens a tokenizer knows.
